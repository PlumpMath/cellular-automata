* What it is

An implementation of some [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata][Cellular Automata]], specifically Brians
Brain and Conway's Game of Life, in Clojure.

* How to use it

To start it in your REPL:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
> (use 'cellular-automata)
> (start-world)
#+END_SRC

To stop it:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
> (stop-world)
#+END_SRC

* Follow ups

- how would transients change the implementation (and performance)?
- how would Clojure Records affect performance?

* Inspiration

This work was originally inspired by [[http://bestinclass.dk/][Lau Jensen]]'s blog post [[http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2009/10/brians-functional-brain.html][Brians Functional Brian]].
